# Documentation for TYPO3.Neos.NodeTypes
A documentation kickoff for the Neos package *TYPO3.Neos.NodeTypes* describing the  available NodeTypes shipped by default.

## Building the documentation
If you want to build the documentation you need [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [Sphinx](http://sphinx-doc.org/latest/install.html).
  
If you have Python installed including the `pip` (Python Package Index) command you could easily install Sphinx  `pip install sphinx`. 

Once you can use `sphinx-build` from the console just navigate to the project folder and call `make html` which
 will build the documentation inside the **build** folder.
